- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily but most people know me as Lirgo
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (duh), mostly in Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning code structure and general rules

- 📫 How to reach me : I'm mostly on Discord, my username is Lirgo#1421, feel free to add me

I attend Polish highschool (2nd grade) and in my free time I mostly code.

My aspirations are to get to MIT and I have some projects up my sleeve

Currently I code in Python and C (Arduino)

- Python - Half a year of experience
- C - 4 years of experience
- Arduino - Half a year of experience

I'm not new to programming and I've always loved watching Coding Train as a kid. 
I've done some small projects in Processing and I've done that for over 6 years...

I also know and sometimes code with p5.js; Java; JavaScript; C++ and C# 

Among my projects were/are:
- Ray Marching for 2D and 3D (Done)
- Rubik's cube solving robot (Some improvements to do but mostly done)
- A rover-like robot with two KUKA-like arms (Done)
- Ping-Pong using above robot (Currently)
- Optimized A* algorithm for non-maze structures (Currently)
- Detecting registration plates with OpenCV (Python) for opening a gate (Currently)
- Making an UI and connection between computers for rocket launching project (Currently)
